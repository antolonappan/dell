Signal and Noise power spectra. Note that, all spectra has a factor
$\frac{L^2(L+1)^2}{2\pi}$

## Fiducial signal
$C_L^{\phi \phi}$ :  *fiducial_Dl_phi_phi.txt*

## Monte Carlo $N^{(0)}$ bias
Foreground model is `s1d1`

$f_{sky} = 0.8$ : *s1d1_fsky_0p8_Dl_MCN0.txt*

$f_{sky} = 0.9$ : *s1d1_fsky_0p9_Dl_MCN0.txt*

## Monte Carlo $N^{(1)}$ bias
Foreground model is `s1d1`

$f_{sky} = 0.9$ : *s1d1_fsky_0p9_Dl_MCN1.txt*
